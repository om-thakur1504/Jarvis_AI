# Jarvis_AI 🤖

Jarvis_AI is a Python-based **AI voice assistant** designed to perform daily tasks through **voice commands**. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to interact with users and automate system operations, web searches, and information retrieval.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a desktop voice assistant similar to *Jarvis*, capable of understanding user commands and executing predefined actions. It enhances productivity by enabling hands-free interaction with the system.

---

## ✨ Features

- Voice-based user interaction  
- Speech recognition (Speech-to-Text)  
- Text-to-speech responses  
- System automation (open applications, files, folders)  
- Web search and information retrieval  
- Weather and basic utility commands  
- Modular and easily extendable architecture  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
- OS & System libraries
- Web scraping libraries (if enabled)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/om-thakur1504/Jarvis_AI.git
cd Jarvis_AI
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Ensure **Python 3.7 or higher** is installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Assistant

```bash
python main.py
```

or

```bash
python run.py
```

---

## 🎙️ Usage

After starting the program, the assistant listens for voice commands.

Example commands:

* “Open Chrome”
* “What is the time?”
* “Search Python tutorials”
* “Tell me the weather”

You can customize or add new commands by modifying the core logic inside the `engine` directory.

---

## 🔧 Customization

* Add new commands in the command handler module
* Integrate APIs for advanced features (news, weather, AI models)
* Improve NLP logic for better intent recognition
